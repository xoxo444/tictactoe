ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe in C
A simple two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game written in C, played directly in the terminal. This version uses a 3x3 board and basic console input/output, making it a great beginner project to understand game logic, arrays, and conditionals.

ðŸ§  Game Features
- 3x3 classic Tic Tac Toe grid
- Two-player turn-based gameplay (`X` and `O`)
- Input validation (prevents invalid or occupied moves)
- Winner and draw detection
- Clear terminal-based UI

 ðŸŽ¯ How to Play
-The board is a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns.

-Player X starts the game.

-Players are prompted to enter the row and column (0-2) where they want to place their mark.

-Invalid or already filled positions will prompt for re-entry.

-The first player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

-If the board fills with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
